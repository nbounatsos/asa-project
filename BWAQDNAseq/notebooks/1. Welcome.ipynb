    "This notebook is that starting point for the online part of the BWA and QDNAseq assignment in the course ‘Algorithms in Sequence Analysis’. The goal of this exercise is for you to familiarize yourself with a common bioinformatics data analysis workflow, so that you may apply it and similar workflows in practice after finishing this assignment.\n",

    "\n",
    "The assignment comprises three notebooks, that will help you answer the questions on Canvas:\n",
    "1. Assignment Introduction (Welcome.ipynb): basic requirements for this assignment and instructions to familiarize you with Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "2. Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) workflow ([BWA.ipynb](2.%20BWA.ipynb)): using BWA for genome alignment.\n",
    "3. QDNAseq workflow ([QDNAseq.ipynb](3.%20QDNAseq.ipynb)): computational workflow performing QDNAseq with R.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you've worked with Jupyter Notebooks before, you can skip the remainder of this notebook and proceed with [BWA.ipynb](2.%20BWA.ipynb) instead. If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, or would like a refresher on useful hotkeys and how Jupyter works, continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Common uses include data cleaning and transformation, code prototyping, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks use two types of cells: Code and Markdown.\n",
    "1. Code is executed in the programming language of the notebook. You can see which type of kernel your notebook is running in the topright corner of your screen: this notebook, as well as [BWA](2.%20BWA.ipynb), runs a Python 3 kernel, whereas [QDNAseq](3.%20QDNAseq.ipynb) interprets code with R instead.\n",
    "2. [Markdown](https://storage.googleapis.com/qdnaseq/docs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) is a \"text-to-HTML\" conversion tool; a lightweight markup language commonly used to render text in browsers, such as readme files (e.g. on Github) or narrative text in Jupyter!\n",

    "1. Command Mode, shown by a blue cell outline (press `Esc` to enable)\n",
    "2. Edit Mode, shown by a green cell outline (press `Enter` to enable)\n",
